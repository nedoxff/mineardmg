# mineardmg

`mineardmg` (short for **mine**craft **ear** **d**a**m**a**g**e) is a small rust application for creating minecraft resource packs which have all of the sounds increased by the specified amount of decibels.

this is my very first rust project so yes, you can poke fun at me or create an [issue](https://github.com/nedoxff/mineardmg/issues)!

## todo

this project is not done yet:
- [x] fetch available minecraft versions
- [x] fetch the assets index
- [ ] fetch the assets themselves
- [ ] process the audio files
- [ ] create a resource pack
- [ ] allow using cli arguments instead of an interactive interface
- [ ] proper readme

## demo

this project is a rewrite of a python script i made 3 years ago, which you can see in action [here](https://youtu.be/eVMP-0ohPjg).

## license

MIT. this is a silly little project for me to learn rust so use it how you'd like.

`mineardmg` is not associated with mojang or microsoft, but it uses their assets.
